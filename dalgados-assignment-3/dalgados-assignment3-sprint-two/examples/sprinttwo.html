I ran into a lot of issues when combining it, there were a lot of syntax errors that I couldn't figure out, which eventually lead to the reason being that I had to fix my permissions on google chrome to work with sound and audio. Another issue is that I had to choose words that wouldn't be confused with something else with chrome - like when I said "clay" it thought I was saying "play", so I had to change thoe word inputs.  */
